# twofac

Webapp allowing users to generate steam-style TOTP codes given a shared secret. 
Also supports storing of shared secrets associated with an alias, to quickly 
generate codes for a number of accounts.

Built with typescript, koajs, and mongoose. This was my first project with 
typescript and koa.

The webapp does not currently run on any server, although it may be available from the domain 
[twof.ac](https://twof.ac) in the future.
